## Who am I

I'm Dhruman Gupta, a high school student (Junior Year) who loves to code and automate things. I aim to make the world a better place by developing quality software and help others start off their programming journey (and learn from my mistakes).

I am the president of the [PSN Hack Club](https://psn.hackclub.com), and together, we are building a community of passionate members.

PS: I'm a competitive person (in a friendly way), so I enjoy participating in events like Hackathons and Game Jams.

## Technology I use (mostly)

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- C#
- Python
- React
- Next.js
- Express.js
- .NET
- TailwindCSS
- Asp.net
- Postgresql
- GitHub
