**TLDR;** I've expanded Better AMS to automatically sync your class schedule from AMS to your calendar, complete with location-based notifications before each class.

## Why?

While manually syncing AMS courses to a calendar is a simple 10-minute process, I found myself procrastinating on it this semester. This project solves that problem and serves as an experiment in building a small-scale application using groupware concepts.

## Technical Stack

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Calendar Integration: Google Calendar API
- Task Scheduling: GitHub Actions
- Deployment: Fly.io
- Email Service: Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP

## How it works

1. Daily data extraction:

   - Network requests pull course data from AMS using axios.
   - Data is parsed and stored in MongoDB using Mongoose models.

2. Hourly sync:

   - A GitHub Action runs every hour to sync calendars with the database.
   - The action uses pnpm for package management and runs in a Node.js environment.

3. User integration:

   - Users register through an Express.js endpoint.
   - Email verification is handled using Nodemailer.
   - When verified, users are added as participants to relevant calendar events.

4. Calendar management:

   - The Google Calendar API is used to create, update, and delete events.
   - Location information is included for each event.

5. Database schema:

   - Mongoose models define schemas for Courses, Events, and ScheduledEvents.
   - Indexes are used on frequently queried fields for performance.

6. Deployment:
   - The application is containerized using Docker.
   - Fly.io is used for hosting, with configuration specified in fly.toml.
