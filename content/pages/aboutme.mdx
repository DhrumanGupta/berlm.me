## About Me

I'm Dhruman Gupta, a 17-year-old, developer, innovator, designer, and technology enthusiast, studying computer science at Ashoka. I'm curious about solving real-world problems people in my community and across the globe face.

I'm currently exploring the stock market, svelte, and machine learning for my projects, and involved with freelance app and web development projects.
