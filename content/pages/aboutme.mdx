## About Me

I'm Dhruman Gupta, a high school student who loves to code and automate things. I aim to make the world a better place by developing quality software and want to help others start off their programming journey.

I am the president of the [PSN Hack Club](https://psn.hackclub.com), and together, we are building a community of passionate members. I like participating in competitive events such as hackathons, game jams, and hack nights. I also like to learn new things and improve my skills.
