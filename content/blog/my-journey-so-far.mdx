In September of 2019, Dani's video - [Making my First Mobile Game (in 1 Week)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgOBnwkE6lc), came up in my youtube recommendation, and I could not believe that he made all that in 1 week. Being a curious kid in grade 8, I decided to download unity and start making AAA games ðŸ˜Ž. This was a good step, but it also led me to a big mistake.

**Tutorial Hell**: I dived into making games and watching unity tutorials without understanding how anything works. I was blindly watching videos on making games without actually understanding what they were trying to teach me. This is what led me to fall deep into tutorial hell. I spent weeks following tutorial playlists, copying code, and blindly doing what they told me. Looking back, I jumped into game development too fast and did not spend time understanding what programming is. If I were to give my old self advice, it would be to understand what programming is and get myself more versed with C# before getting into Unity. I believe this applies to any other field â€” you learn how to walk before running. When written, it seems astoundingly obvious, but it is equally easy to fall into something like that when working with something new and exciting without any experience.

## Mount Stupid

While I got over tutorial hell and got better at programming, I was still limited to Unity. Not C#, but Unity. I could implement logic and program in C#, but that only got as far as using Unity's libraries. Other than that, I was still heavily limited with concepts like IO, networking, and anything outside of Unity's primary libraries. I also got to work with technologies like Android Studio and Java, Python, and some other tools. Even though I explored different languages, I still stuck with the basics and was focused only on developing logic. It was not until March 2020, when I participated in the [Reply Code Challenge](https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/code-teen-edition) with a friend, that I _realized_ my limitations (yes, that is seven months!). I was able to solve the problem in my mind and on paper, but when it came to programming it, I could not even parse the input, let alone work with it. Nonetheless, it was a big hit to my confidence. We only got 150 points (out of 5000!) by manually solving the problems with smaller inputs.

The competition itself was a complete failure. However, it was a blessing in disguise. Not to sound cliche, but I started to see so much more of what there is, mainly things I could not even begin to comprehend. If you look closely at the header image, you can see that I used an exaggerated [Dunning Kruger curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) to describe my progress. I had just been on "Mount Stupid" and was now in the "Valley of Despair." As a goal, I saved the problem statement, sample input, and the little code I had in a folder in the corner of my desktop. Whenever I opened my laptop, I saw that folder staring at me. It was a challenge I had set for myself â€” I needed to get enough knowledge to solve this problem within three months. I would then compare the code I had saved to the code I had written to see what all had changed, other than solving the problem. Surprisingly, this worked a lot better than I had thought it would. I put it there in hopes of remembering the competition after three months and seeing my growth, but instead, every time I would open my laptop to slack off, watch a show on Netflix, or a video on YouTube, I would see that folder. It would push me enough to learn and work on something instead of wasting my time. Of course, this does not mean I was productive the entire day. No, I did procrastinate a lot. However, after a long time, I found something I enjoyed studying.

## Slope of Enlightenment

Luckily, my summer breaks started when my 3-month challenge ended. I spent the entire vacation playing GTA 5, finishing school reports, and learning new technologies. By the end of my breaks, I had learned much more about C# and Python and got familiar with concepts like Networks and Relational Databases. I continued this learning streak for the larger part of the first semester of grade 10 (sophomore year). I became familiar and more advanced with concepts like Object Oriented Programming, developing maintainable codebases, and Best Practices. I also started using Git and GitHub, which have proven to be a gem. During this entire time, I put my head down to learn and understand the concepts I had heard about in more detail. Of course, it was not as enjoyable as building fun, small applications, but the time I spent was quite fruitful. Not only did it make me more competent, but it also increased my confidence and helped me get acquainted with others in the field.

## Why are you telling me this?

This serves not as a story, but rather as my learnings.
