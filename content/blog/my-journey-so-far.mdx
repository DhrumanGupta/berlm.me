In September of 2019, Dani's video - [Making my First Mobile Game (in 1 Week)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgOBnwkE6lc), came up in my youtube recommendation. I was shocked by how much he accomplished in one week. Being a curious kid in grade 8, I decided to download unity and start making AAA games ðŸ˜Ž. This was definitely a good step, but it also led me to a big mistake.

#### Tutorial Hell

I dived straight into making games and watching unity tutorials without understanding how anything works. I was blindly watching videos on making games without actually understanding what they were trying to teach me. This is what led me to fall deep into [tutorial hell](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tutorial%20Hell). I spent weeks following tutorial playlists, copying code, and blindly doing what they told me.

Looking back, I jumped into game development too fast and did not understand what programming is at its core. If I were to give my old self advice, it would be to understand what programming really is, and get myself more versed with C# before getting into Unity. I believe this applies to any other field &#8212; you learn how to walk before running.
