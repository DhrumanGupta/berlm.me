## Origins: Orientation Week

Orientation week started, and I was excited to meet new people and make new friends. I was also excited to start my university journey. However, my third day here -- the day of the computer science expo -- I was told that calculus had become a requirement. I was shocked. I had done AP Calculus BC and IB Math AA HL in high school. So like every first-year, I had been thinking I was done with calculus and could move on to more interesting math courses.

I, in no way, wanted to take this course. Afterall, why would I need to learn calculus _again_? Trying everything, from approaching representatives and talking to seniors, to asking professors if this would be possible, I was told that I would have to take the course. I was disappointed, but I had no choice.
